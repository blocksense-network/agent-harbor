//! Domain types for the Agent Harbor software suite
//!
//! This crate contains the core domain types that are shared across
//! different parts of the Agent Harbor system, including the TUI,
//! REST API, local database, and other components.
//!
//! These types represent the business domain entities and should be
//! UI-agnostic, reusable across different contexts.
