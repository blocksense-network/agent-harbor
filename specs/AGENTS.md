This folder contains a work-in-progress specification for the next iteration of the agents-workflow product.

The main ideas of the product are described in the [marketing-one-pager](../docs/marketing-one-pager.md) document.

Currently, the spec is not finalized and we are not ready to start the implementation of the software. The folder `specs/@initial-developer-input` contains files that should be treated as a ground truth for the specification effort. You are expected to work on the markdown files in the specs folder, which should detail everything with a much higher precision, but not all information in them has been fully reviewed by the development team yet.

Some of the markdown files have standardized Obsidian headers indicating their current review status. Avoid modifying files which status is "Reviewed" or "Final" unless explicitly asked.
