# OpenCode â€” Integration Notes

> Usually this information can be obtained by checking out command-line help screens or man pages for the agent software.

## Overview

OpenCode is an open-source AI coding assistant CLI tool with TUI and headless server capabilities, supporting multiple AI providers and custom agents.

- **Website**: <https://opencode.dev/>
- **Documentation**: <https://docs.opencode.dev/>
- **GitHub**: <https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode>
- **Version**: 0.6.3 (as of this writing)

### Task start-up command

OpenCode can be started with a specific task prompt in several ways:

1. **Interactive TUI with prompt**:

   ```bash
   opencode --prompt "Implement a user authentication system"
   ```

2. **Run command with message**:

   ```bash
   opencode run "Generate unit tests for this function"
   ```

3. **Continue last session**:

   ```bash
   opencode --continue
   ```

4. **Continue specific session**:

   ```bash
   opencode --session <session-id>
   ```

5. **With specific model**:

   ```bash
   opencode --model openai/gpt-4 "Refactor this legacy code"
   ```

6. **With custom agent**:
   ```bash
   opencode --agent my-custom-agent "Implement feature X"
   ```

### Built-in support for checkpoints

Yes, OpenCode supports session-based checkpoints. The checkpoints cover **both chat content and file system state**.

**Session Management:**

- **Session continuation**: `--continue` resumes the last session
- **Session ID resumption**: `--session <id>` resumes a specific session by ID
- **Session export**: `opencode export [sessionID]` exports session data as JSON
- **Session sharing**: `--share` flag for sharing sessions
- **Automatic session tracking**: Sessions are automatically saved with unique IDs

**Checkpoint Coverage:**

- **Chat content**: Full conversation history and context is preserved and restored
- **File system state**: Working directory and project context is maintained
- **Tool execution history**: Preserved within the session data

**Restoring from Specific Moments:**

- **By session ID**: Use `--session <sessionId>` to restore a specific session
- **By last session**: Use `--continue` to restore the most recent session
- **No granular restoration**: Cannot restore to a specific chat message or prompt position within a session
- **File system restoration**: Maintains working directory context but does not restore file snapshots

**Session Storage:**

- **Format**: JSON export format available via `opencode export`
- **Persistence**: Sessions persist across OpenCode restarts
- **Sharing**: Sessions can be shared using the `--share` flag

**Limitations:**

- No file system snapshots - only maintains working directory context
- No ability to rollback file changes made during a session
- Session restoration maintains conversation and directory context but not file states
- No ability to restore to specific points within a conversation

### How is the use of MCP servers configured?

OpenCode does not appear to have built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server support based on available help documentation:

**Command-line options:**

- No MCP-related command-line options documented

**MCP management commands:**

- No MCP management commands available

**Configuration files:**

- No MCP configuration files documented

**Environment variables:**

- No MCP-related environment variables documented

Note: OpenCode may support MCP indirectly through provider integrations, but no direct MCP server configuration is documented.

### Support for custom hooks

For Agent Time Travel feature (commands executed after every agent step), OpenCode does not appear to have built-in support for custom step-level hooks. However, it does provide customization through:

1. **Custom Agents**:
   - **Agent creation**: `opencode agent create` to create new custom agents
   - **Agent selection**: `--agent` flag to specify which agent to use
   - **Agent configuration**: Agents can be customized with different behaviors and capabilities

2. **Provider Integration**:
   - **Multi-provider support**: Supports various AI providers through the model system
   - **GitHub integration**: `opencode github` command for GitHub-specific agent management
   - **Model selection**: `-m, --model` to specify provider/model combinations

3. **Server Mode**:
   - **Headless server**: `opencode serve` starts a headless server
   - **Network configuration**: `--port` and `--hostname` for server configuration
   - **API access**: Server mode enables programmatic access to OpenCode functionality

Note: While custom agents and server mode provide extensibility, there is no documented support for automatic execution of custom commands after every agent step as required for the Agent Time Travel feature.

### Credentials

OpenCode uses a provider-based authentication system with the following precise storage locations:

**Authentication methods:**

- **Provider login**: `opencode auth login [url]` to authenticate with providers
- **Logout**: `opencode auth logout` to remove credentials
- **List providers**: `opencode auth list` to see configured providers

**Configuration files:**

- **Main config directory**: Stored in OS-specific application data directories
- **Provider-specific configs**: Individual provider authentication stored within main config
- **Local configuration**: Project-specific or user-specific configuration files

**Environment variables:**

- Provider-specific environment variables for API keys (varies by provider)
- Standard API key environment variables for supported providers

**Precise storage paths** (platform-dependent):

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/opencode/` or `~/.local/share/opencode/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\opencode\` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\opencode\`
- **Secure storage**: Authentication tokens stored in OS keychain/keyring systems when available

**Provider-specific storage:**

- Different AI providers may use different credential storage mechanisms
- Some providers may use API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication methods

### Known Issues

- **Early development**: As a newer tool (v0.6.3), some features may be in active development
- **Provider compatibility**: Feature availability may vary across different AI providers
- **Network dependency**: Requires internet access for AI provider communication
- **TUI limitations**: Terminal user interface may have limitations on some systems
- **Agent customization**: Custom agent creation and management features are still evolving
