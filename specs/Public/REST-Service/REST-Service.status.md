# Agent Harbor REST Service - Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the Agent Harbor REST service as specified in [API.md](API.md) and [Tech-Stack.md](Tech-Stack.md). The REST service provides the network API for creating and managing agent coding sessions, supporting both on-premises deployments and local developer workflows.

## Architecture Summary

The REST service implementation spans multiple Rust crates as defined in [Repository-Layout.md](../Repository-Layout.md):

- **ah-core**: Core domain types including TaskManager trait
- **ah-rest-api-contract**: Shared types, schemas, validation (contract-first design)
- **ah-rest-client**: Type-safe production client library implementing TaskManager trait
- **ah-rest-mock-client**: Mock client with simulated tokio time for MVVM-style testing
- **ah-rest-server**: Production server with SQLite backend and task orchestration
- **ah-cli integration**: `ah webui` and `ah agent access-point` commands

**Note**: The mock REST server already exists in `webui/mock-server/` and will be used for testing the production client.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a **bottom-up, contract-first** approach:

1. **Milestone 1 & 2**: Define shared API contract types and TaskManager trait in ah-core
2. **Milestone 3**: Implement mock client with tokio time simulation for TUI testing
3. **Milestone 4**: Build production REST client library tested against existing webui/mock-server
4. **Milestones 5-13**: Implement production server with task orchestration incrementally
5. **Milestones 14-16**: Integrate with CLI commands (`ah webui`, `ah agent access-point`, `ah agent enroll`)
6. **Milestone 17**: Implement WebUI proxy integration
7. **Milestone 18**: Comprehensive end-to-end integration testing

This strategy enables parallel development tracks while maintaining type safety and API consistency. The mock client (M3) enables TUI development to continue independently while the production client (M4) validates the existing mock server.

- **Dependencies**: Added `ah-domain-types`, `async-trait`, and `futures` to Cargo.toml
- **Naming Resolution**: Renamed existing concrete `TaskManager` to `TaskStateManager` to avoid conflicts

## Milestone 18: End-to-End Integration Testing

**Status**: Not Started

### Deliverables

- [ ] Full stack integration tests (CLI → Server → Task Execution)
- [ ] Multi-session concurrent execution tests
- [ ] Fleet orchestration tests (if implemented)

- [ ] Observability integration tests (metrics, tracing)

### Verification

- [ ] Tasks created via CLI execute successfully on server

- [ ] Session events stream correctly to multiple clients
- [ ] Server recovers gracefully from crashes
- [ ] Network interruptions handled with reconnection
- [ ] Performance meets target thresholds (TBD)
- [ ] Metrics exported correctly (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry)

### Test Strategy

- End-to-end scenario tests covering complete workflows
- Chaos testing (kill processes, disconnect network, fill disk)
- Load testing with progressively higher concurrency
- Observability validation tests
- Client compatibility tests (REST client, TUI, WebUI)

## Implementation Notes

### Development Order

1. **Milestone 1** (API Contract) and **Milestone 2** (TaskManager Trait) - foundation for all other work
2. **Milestone 3** (Mock Client) for TUI testing with simulated tokio time
3. **Milestone 4** (Production Client) tested against existing webui/mock-server
4. Both clients implement TaskManager trait, enabling drop-in replacement
5. Production server milestones (5-13) can proceed incrementally
6. CLI integration (14-16) once server is functional
7. WebUI proxy (17) after CLI integration complete
8. End-to-end testing (18) throughout, but comprehensive suite at end

**Key Dependencies:**

- Milestones 3 and 4 both depend on Milestones 1 and 2
- Milestone 3 (mock client) enables TUI development to continue independently
- Milestone 4 (production client) tests against existing webui/mock-server (may identify needed improvements)

### Testing Philosophy

- **Contract tests** ensure client and server agree on API shape
- **Mock client** enables TUI testing with simulated time (tokio::time::pause)
  - Supports MVVM-style testing as demonstrated in PoC/tui-exploration
  - ViewModels tested independently with accelerated time simulation
  - See PoC/tui-exploration/src/view_model.rs for testing patterns
- **Existing mock server** (webui/mock-server) validates production client behavior
- **Integration tests** validate real behavior against specifications
- **Property-based tests** for serialization and validation logic
- **Chaos tests** ensure resilience and recovery
- **Load tests** identify performance bottlenecks early

### Key Technical Decisions

- **SQLite** for initial state backend (can migrate to Postgres later)
- **Axum** for HTTP framework (mature, well-integrated with Tower ecosystem)
- **utoipa** for OpenAPI generation (compile-time checking)
- **SSE over WebSocket** (simpler, better HTTP compatibility, easier proxy)
- **In-process daemon** for `ah webui` (simpler deployment, lower latency)
- **QUIC control plane** for executor enrollment (better NAT traversal, multiplexing)

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Postgres backend for scaled deployments
- Redis for distributed state and pub/sub
- WebSocket support alongside SSE
- gRPC control plane as alternative to QUIC
- Kubernetes operator for cluster deployments
- Multi-tenancy with full isolation
- Advanced RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- Secrets management integration (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

- OpenSSL or rustls (for TLS)
- Git (for repository operations)

### Development Tools

## Success Criteria

The REST service implementation is considered complete when:

1. All milestones have passing verification tests
2. Full [API.md](API.md) specification implemented in production server
3. TaskManager trait defined in ah-core enables abstraction over local/remote execution
4. Mock client enables TUI testing with simulated tokio time
5. Production REST client tested against existing webui/mock-server
6. Both clients are drop-in replacements via TaskManager trait
7. `ah webui` and `ah agent access-point` commands work as specified in [CLI.md](../CLI.md)
8. Tasks launched remotely execute via `ah agent start` wrapped in `ah agent record`
9. End-to-end workflows (create task → execute → stream events → view results) work reliably
10. Documentation complete with examples and troubleshooting guides
11. Performance meets target thresholds (TBD based on load testing)
12. Security model (authentication, authorization, audit logging) fully functional
