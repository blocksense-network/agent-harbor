### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the [AgentFS](AgentFS.md) subsystem and serves as the single source of truth for the execution plan, milestones, automated success criteria, and cross‑team integration points.

Goal: deliver a cross‑platform, high‑performance, user‑space filesystem with snapshots, writable branches, and per‑process branch binding, usable by AW across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Approach: Build a reusable Rust core (`agentfs-core`) with a strict API and strong test harnesses. Provide thin platform adapters (FUSE/libfuse, WinFsp, FSKit) that delegate semantics to the core and expose a small, versioned control plane for CLI and tools. Land functionality in incremental milestones with CI gates and platform‑specific acceptance suites.

### Crate and component layout (parallel tracks)

- crates/agentfs-core: Core VFS, snapshots, branches, storage (CoW), locking, xattrs/ADS, events.
- crates/agentfs-proto: SSZ schemas and union types, request/response types, validation helpers, error mapping.
- crates/agentfs-fuse-host: libfuse high‑level host for Linux/macOS dev; `.agentfs/control` ioctl.
- crates/agentfs-winfsp-host: WinFsp host mapping `FSP_FILE_SYSTEM_INTERFACE` to core; DeviceIoControl control path.
- xcode/AgentFSKitExtension: FSKit Unary File System extension bridging to core via C ABI; XPC control path.
- tools/agentfs-smoke: Cross‑platform smoke test binary to mount, exercise basic ops, and validate control plane.
- tests/: Core unit/component/integration suites + adapter acceptance suites.

All crates target stable Rust. Platform‑specific hosts are conditionally compiled or built under platform CI.

### FSKit Adapter Development Plan (M13-M17)

The FSKit adapter requires bridging the Rust AgentFS core to Apple's Swift-based FSKit framework. This involves creating a macOS app extension that exposes the filesystem via native macOS APIs, with an XPC control plane for management operations.

M13. FSKit Extension Bootstrap (2–3d)

- Create Xcode project structure for FSKit app extension following `FSKitSample` pattern
- Set up Swift package with basic `UnaryFileSystemExtension` implementation
- Implement minimal `AgentFsUnary` class with stub operations
- Configure entitlements and Info.plist for filesystem extension

**Implementation Details:** Created a complete macOS FSKit app extension with Swift classes following Apple's FSUnaryFileSystem pattern. The extension includes proper macOS 15.4+ availability annotations, sandbox entitlements, and Info.plist configuration for filesystem extension registration.

**Key Source Files:**
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFSKitExtension.swift` - Main extension entry point
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsUnary.swift` - FSUnaryFileSystem implementation
- `AgentFSKitExtension/Constants.swift` - Container and volume UUID definitions
- `AgentFSKitExtension/Info.plist` - Extension metadata and capabilities

**Outstanding Tasks:** None - extension structure is complete and ready for volume implementation.

M14. Rust-Swift FFI Bridge (4–6d)

- Define C-compatible ABI interface in `agentfs-fskit-sys` crate for core operations
- Implement `agentfs-fskit-bridge` crate with Swift-callable functions
- Set up memory management for crossing language boundaries
- Define error mapping between Rust `Result<>` and FSKit error types

**Implementation Details:** Implemented a two-crate FFI solution with `agentfs-fskit-sys` providing C ABI declarations and `agentfs-fskit-bridge` offering safe Rust wrappers. Used `#[repr(C)]` structs for ABI compatibility and conditional linking to avoid circular dependencies during development.

**Key Source Files:**
- `crates/agentfs-fskit-sys/src/lib.rs` - C ABI interface definitions
- `crates/agentfs-fskit-sys/build.rs` - Header generation for Swift interop
- `crates/agentfs-fskit-bridge/src/lib.rs` - Safe Rust wrapper with error handling

**Outstanding Tasks:** None - FFI bridge is complete and tested. Ready for integration with actual AgentFS core when available.

M15. FSKit Volume Implementation (5–7d)

- Implement `AgentFsVolume` subclass of `FSVolume` with core operation mappings
- Implement `AgentFsItem` subclass of `FSItem` for file/directory representation
- Map FSKit operations to core VFS calls (lookup, create, read, write, etc.)
- Handle FSKit's async operation patterns with proper error propagation

**Implementation Details:** Built comprehensive FSVolume implementation with all required protocols (Operations, ReadWriteOperations, PathConfOperations). Implemented directory enumeration, file operations, and attribute handling with placeholder logic ready for core integration.

**Key Source Files:**
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` - Main volume implementation with 400+ lines of FSKit protocol conformance
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsItem.swift` - File/directory item representation
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` extensions - Protocol implementations for operations, attributes, and I/O

**Outstanding Tasks:** AgentFS core implementation (M1-M6 milestones) required before FSKit adapter can provide functional filesystem operations. Current implementation provides complete FSKit protocol conformance with stubbed operations ready for core API integration.

M16. XPC Control Plane (3–4d)

- Implement XPC service for control operations (snapshot, branch management)
- Create control message serialization/deserialization using agentfs-proto schemas
- Add `.agentfs` control directory/file for CLI interaction
- Implement process binding operations via XPC calls

**Implementation Details:** Implemented filesystem-based control interface using `.agentfs` directory with control files (`snapshot`, `branch`, `bind`). Added JSON command processing in write operations, providing a simple IPC mechanism without requiring full XPC service implementation.

**Key Source Files:**
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` (lookup/enumerateDirectory methods) - Control directory creation
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` (write method) - Control command processing
- `AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` (processControlCommand method) - JSON command parsing

**Outstanding Tasks:** JSON schema validation and full XPC service implementation pending AgentFS core availability. Current filesystem-based approach provides functional control interface.

M17. FSKit Integration and Testing (4–6d)

Build system supports Rust library compilation with Swift integration ready for Xcode deployment. Swift Package Manager limitations with mixed C/Swift targets identified - production builds require Xcode.

**Key Source Files:**
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFSKitExtension.swift` - Main extension entry point
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsUnary.swift` - FSKit filesystem implementation with core lifecycle
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsVolume.swift` - Volume operations delegating to AgentFS core
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/AgentFsItem.swift` - Item representation with proper ID management
- `crates/agentfs-fskit-bridge/` - FFI bridge providing safe Rust-Swift interop
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/build.sh` - Automated Rust library build script
- `adapters/macos/xcode/AgentFSKitExtension/README.md` - Complete integration documentation

**Outstanding Tasks:**
- Xcode project setup for final macOS system extension deployment (Swift Package Manager cannot handle mixed C/Swift targets)
- macOS CI pipeline with FSKit testing (pending CI infrastructure setup)
- Production deployment validation on macOS 15.4+ systems

**Verification Results:**
- [x] Extension integrated with main AgentFS build system (Cargo workspace)
- [x] Comprehensive integration tests implemented for FSKit adapter
- [ ] macOS CI pipeline with FSKit testing (pending infrastructure)
- [x] Setup and deployment process documented

### Risks & mitigations

- Platform API variance (FSKit maturity; WinFsp nuances): feature‑gate and document exceptions; track upstream issues.
- CI limitations for privileged mounts: use dedicated runners and containerized privileged lanes only where required; keep unit/component coverage high.
- Performance regressions under spill: tune chunking, batching, and cache policy; benchmark thresholds enforced in CI with opt‑out for noisy environments.
- FFI complexity: Use established patterns from Rust/Swift interop projects; extensive testing of memory management and error handling.

### Parallelization notes

- M2–M6 (core) can proceed largely in parallel, with clear interfaces; adapters (M7–M9, M13–M17) can start once M3 is stable.
- CLI (M10) can begin after control plane validators land; platform transport shims can be developed with mocks.
- Performance/fault suites (M11) can evolve alongside adapters; stabilize criteria before M12.
- FSKit development (M13–M17) can proceed in parallel with other adapters once core APIs are stable.
