TODO: This file has been moved to a section in [Multi-OS Testing](Multi-OS%20Testing.md). Re-target all inbound links to it to the correct section.
TODO: This file has been superseded. Connectivity is now specified in the “Multi‑OS Testing” document.

See: specs/Public/Multi-OS Testing.md (sections: Execution Cycle, Hybrid Multi‑Hop Forwarding, Session setup details, Connectivity Algorithm).

Note: Retarget inbound links to those sections. This file remains as a placeholder to aid navigation during the refactor.
