### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status and plan for the Agent Harbor GUI, a cross-platform native desktop application that provides a graphical interface wrapper around the `ah webui` process with native desktop integrations.

Goal: deliver a production-ready cross-platform desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux) that embeds the WebUI, handles the `agent-harbor://` URL scheme, provides native system integrations (tray, notifications), and bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for seamless installation.

Total estimated timeline: 17-21 weeks (phased with parallel development tracks)

**Current Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planning phase - comprehensive implementation plan defined
**Last Updated**: January 14, 2025

### Key Design Principles

Per [Agent-Workflow-GUI.md](Agent-Workflow-GUI.md), the GUI is a **thin native wrapper** that:
- Embeds and manages the existing WebUI (already functional with 23/162 E2E tests passing)
- Delegates all workflow functionality to the underlying WebUI
- Provides native OS integration (system tray, notifications, URL scheme handling)
- Bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for unified installation
- Maintains cross-platform consistency while respecting platform conventions

### Architecture Overview

**Component Separation:**
- **Electron GUI Shell**: Handles window management, native OS integrations, and WebUI process lifecycle
- **Embedded Chromium**: Provides browser automation capabilities for cloud agent integrations (Codex, etc.)
- **WebUI Process**: Existing SolidJS/SolidStart application serving the main UI (reused as-is)
  - **Key Optimization**: Runs via Electron's bundled Node.js using `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Eliminates need for separate Node.js installation (~50-80MB saved)
- **CLI Toolchain**: Complete set of `ah` commands bundled for installation
- **URL Scheme Handler**: Rust binary handling `agent-harbor://` protocol (shared with headless systems)

**Technology Stack:**
- **GUI Framework**: Electron (cross-platform with Chromium)
  - **Critical Rationale**: Browser automation capability required for cloud agent integrations
    - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) specs for Codex and other cloud platforms
    - Playwright automation requires stable Chromium binary (shipped with Electron)
    - Reduces browser compatibility issues on user machines
    - Enables headless/headful automation with persistent browser profiles
  - **Additional Benefits**:
    - Cross-platform consistency (single codebase for macOS/Windows/Linux)
    - Rich ecosystem for native integrations
    - Well-established packaging and distribution patterns
- **WebUI Embedding**: Electron BrowserWindow loading `http://localhost:PORT` from WebUI process
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright with Electron's Chromium for cloud agent workflows
- **Process Management**: Rust crates for WebUI process lifecycle, packaged as native Node addons
- **Native Extensions**: Small CLI helpers or native Electron modules for system-specific functions
- **URL Handler**: Rust binary per [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### Parallel Development Tracks

Once foundation is established (M0-M1), multiple tracks can proceed in parallel:

- **macOS Native Track**: AppKit/SwiftUI host application with WKWebView embedding
- **Cross-Platform WebUI Track**: Continue WebUI development (ongoing in parallel)
- **CLI Bundling Track**: Packaging and PATH integration for bundled CLI tools
- **URL Scheme Track**: Protocol handler implementation (see [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md))
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Native UI testing framework setup

**M0.2.5 WebUI Embedding Strategy Evaluation** âœ… **COMPLETED** (1 week, depends on M0.2)

- **Deliverables**:

  **Evaluate WebUI Integration Approaches:**

  **Architecture Investigation:**
  - Evaluated SolidStart SSR vs CSR builds for Electron embedding
  - Discovered SolidStart's file-based routing incompatibility with pure CSR
  - Identified "use server" directives as key difference between SSR/CSR modes
  - Validated that REST API fetch logic is 99% identical between modes
  - Confirmed static build viability for production use

  **Final Architecture Decision:**
  - **Electron GUI delegates to `ah webui` command** (launched as subprocess)
  - **`ah webui` serves both static files AND REST API** on localhost
  - **Electron BrowserWindow loads from `http://localhost:PORT`**
  - **Static files bundled with `ah` CLI binary** (compressed archive)
  - **Shared implementation**: `ah webui` and `ah serve` share REST service code

  **Key Benefits:**
  1. **Unified Architecture**: Same `ah webui` process for both CLI and GUI use cases
  2. **Code Reuse**: Single WebUI build works for browser and Electron
  3. **Simplified Testing**: Mock REST server can impersonate `ah webui` (via ENV override)
  4. **Resource Efficiency**: No separate static file bundling needed in Electron
  5. **Consistency**: Browser users and Electron users get identical UI experience
  6. **Maintenance**: Single codebase for WebUI, single build pipeline

  **Architecture Comparison:**
  - **Subprocess Delegation** (SELECTED - Production Architecture)
    - Static files: Bundled in `ah` CLI binary (compressed archive)
    - REST API: Provided by `ah webui` subprocess
    - Loading: Electron BrowserWindow â†’ `http://localhost:PORT` from `ah webui`
    - Benefits: Unified architecture, code reuse, testing flexibility, single build
    - Implementation: Electron manages `ah webui` subprocess lifecycle

  - **Static Embedding in Electron** (EXPLORATORY - Investigation Only)
    - Static files: Bundled separately in Electron resources
    - REST API: Mock server or separate backend
    - Loading: Electron BrowserWindow â†’ `app://` protocol or `file://`
    - Status: Implemented during M0.2.5 investigation to validate CSR compatibility
    - Learnings: Manual routing required, 99% code reuse achieved in data-fetching
    - Not for production: Would duplicate WebUI builds and increase maintenance burden

- **Investigation Outcomes**:
  - Both approaches (subprocess delegation and static embedding) were prototyped
  - CSR/SSR dual-build feasibility validated with 99% code reuse in data-fetching layer
  - Manual routing proved necessary for CSR-only builds (FileRoutes requires SSR infrastructure)
  - Protocol handler and dynamic asset loading successfully implemented in prototypes
  - Performance characteristics measured: Startup < 500ms, Memory < 100MB for static build

- **Architectural Decision**:
  - **Selected Approach**: Static build served via `ah webui` subprocess
  - **Rationale**:
    - Static CSR build minimizes runtime resource usage (no SSR overhead)
    - `ah webui` subprocess serves both static files and REST API on single port
    - Avoids protocol handler complexity and asset management in Electron
    - Enables unified access point architecture (same command for CLI and GUI)
    - Clean separation: Electron handles UI chrome, `ah webui` handles application logic
  - **Trade-offs Accepted**:
    - Requires maintaining CSR build configuration alongside SSR
    - Additional process management in Electron main process
    - Dependency on `ah webui` command availability

- **Verification Results**:
  - [x] Both PoCs implemented and functional
  - [x] Static build approach fully documented with pros/cons
  - [x] Subprocess delegation approach fully documented
  - [x] Performance characteristics measured and documented
  - [x] **Playwright browser version compatibility fixed**: Upgraded to 1.54.2 (chromium-1181)
  - [x] **Yarn PnP re-enabled**: Development environment uses PnP for module resolution
  - [x] **SSR workflows preserved and verified**: `just webui-test` passing (API + E2E tests)
  - [x] **Architecture decision finalized**: Subprocess delegation selected
  - [x] Investigation artifacts cleaned up (prototypes and CSR-specific code removed)

**M0.3 WebUI Process Management** (2 weeks, depends on M0.2.5)

- **Note**: Following the M0.2.5 architecture decision, this milestone implements subprocess delegation to `ah webui` command instead of static file embedding.

  - Electron BrowserWindow configured to load from `http://localhost:PORT`
  - Graceful process startup and shutdown
  - Error handling and subprocess recovery
  - Loading screen with process status indication
  - Build automation: `just electron-dev` launches `ah webui` automatically
  - Mock REST server integration for testing (via ENV override)

- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Process Management**:
    - Main process spawns `ah webui` as child process
    - Capture stdout/stderr for logging and diagnostics
    - Monitor process health (restart on unexpected exit)
    - Graceful shutdown: SIGTERM â†’ wait â†’ SIGKILL if needed
    - Use Node.js `child_process.spawn()` with proper signal handling
  - **Health Check**:
    - Poll `http://localhost:PORT/health` or similar endpoint
    - Timeout after 10s if no response
    - Show loading screen during health check
    - Display error if health check fails
  - **Loading Mechanism**:
    - BrowserWindow loads `http://localhost:PORT` after health check passes
    - Standard HTTP loading (no custom protocols needed)
    - WebUI handles routing internally (no Electron routing complexity)
  - **Testing Integration**:
    - ENV variable `AH_WEBUI_COMMAND` overrides default `ah webui` path
    - Mock REST server can be used: `AH_WEBUI_COMMAND=./mock-server`
    - Playwright tests use mock server for isolation

- **Platform-Specific Considerations**:
  - **macOS**: `ah` binary in bundled CLI path (`Contents/Resources/cli/ah`)
  - **Windows**: `ah.exe` in bundled CLI path (`resources\cli\ah.exe`)

### Risks & Mitigations

**Browser Automation Stability:**
- Risk: Cloud platform UI changes break automation
- Mitigation: Use stable selectors (role/aria); fail fast with diagnostics; screenshot on error; version-specific selector strategies

**Chromium Version Compatibility:**
- Risk: Electron's Chromium version differs from Playwright expectations
- Mitigation: Use Playwright's chromium channel matching Electron version; test automation against Electron's Chromium in CI

**Code Signing Complexity:**
- Risk: Signing workflows differ significantly across platforms
- Mitigation: Detailed documentation in [Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md); automate in CI; use GitHub Secrets for credentials

**Update Mechanism Reliability:**
- Risk: Auto-updates fail and leave app in broken state
- Mitigation: Implement robust rollback mechanism; extensive testing; phased rollout

**URL Scheme Security:**
- Risk: Malicious URLs exploit GUI or WebUI
- Mitigation: Strict input validation; confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions; security audit

**Performance Overhead:**
- Risk: Electron + WebUI + Browser automation create large application footprint
- Mitigation: Code splitting; lazy-load automation code; asar compression; performance benchmarking

**Electron Application Size:**
- Risk: Bundled Chromium makes installer large (150-200MB+)
- Mitigation:
  - Reuse Electron's Node.js for WebUI server (saves ~50-80MB by not bundling separate Node.js)
  - Document download size clearly
  - Delta updates for subsequent releases
  - Consider separate "lite" version without automation

**ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE Compatibility:**
- Risk: WebUI server may not run correctly under Electron's Node.js
- Mitigation:
  - Test WebUI server thoroughly with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Electron's Node.js is mostly compatible, differences mainly in crypto/OpenSSL
  - Fall back to bundled standalone Node.js if compatibility issues arise
  - See [Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md) for details

- WebUI continues independent development with E2E test suite
- GUI consumes WebUI as HTTP server on localhost
- No changes required to WebUI for GUI embedding

**CLI Integration:**
- Bundles all CLI binaries from Rust workspace
- Shares configuration files (`~/.config/agent-harbor/` or `AH_HOME`)
- CLI and GUI coordinate via shared state files
- URL handler binary shared between headless and GUI modes

**URL Scheme Integration:**
- Implements [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.md](Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.md) specification
- Electron's built-in protocol handling APIs
- electron-builder configures protocol registration in installers
- Single-instance lock prevents multiple GUI instances

**Browser Automation Integration:**
- Implements [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) specifications
- Playwright uses Electron's bundled Chromium
- Agent browser profiles stored in user data directory
- IPC API exposes automation to WebUI and CLI

**System Extension Integration (macOS):**
- Electron GUI and native `apps/macos/AgentHarbor/` are separate applications
- Native host app required by Apple for system extension registration
- Electron GUI can optionally communicate with system extension via IPC
- Both apps can be distributed together in a bundle or independently

### Notes on Electron Decision

**Why Electron:**
- **Browser Automation is Critical**: Cloud agent support requires reliable browser automation
  - Codex, Claude, and other cloud platforms need programmatic interaction
  - Playwright requires stable Chromium binary for consistent automation
  - Electron ships with Chromium, reducing user-side browser compatibility issues
  - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) for detailed automation requirements
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Single codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Mature tooling for native integrations (notifications, tray, protocols)
- **Well-Established Patterns**: electron-builder provides proven packaging and distribution

**macOS System Extension Integration:**
- Electron GUI and native `apps/macos/AgentHarbor/` host app coexist as separate applications
- System extension remains in native AppKit/SwiftUI host (required by Apple)
- Electron GUI can communicate with system extension via IPC when available
- Both apps can be distributed together or independently

**Trade-offs:**
- **Application Size**: Electron apps are larger (150-200MB) due to bundled Chromium
  - Mitigation: Document download size; delta updates; consider compression
- **Memory Footprint**: Chromium process uses more memory than native web views
  - Mitigation: Performance monitoring; meet defined targets (< 150MB at idle)
- **Native Feel**: May not feel as native as platform-specific UIs
  - Mitigation: Use native window chrome where appropriate; follow platform conventions

**Alternative Considered: Tauri**
- Tauri uses system web views (WebKit/WebView2) instead of bundled Chromium
- **Rejected** because: System web views don't provide reliable automation environment
  - Browser automation requires consistent Chromium version
  - System WebKit/WebView2 versions vary across user machines
  - Playwright automation targets specific Chromium versions
