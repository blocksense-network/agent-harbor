### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status and plan for the Agent Harbor GUI, a cross-platform native desktop application that provides a graphical interface wrapper around the `ah webui` process with native desktop integrations.

Goal: deliver a production-ready cross-platform desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux) that embeds the WebUI, handles the `agent-harbor://` URL scheme, provides native system integrations (tray, notifications), and bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for seamless installation.

Total estimated timeline: 17-21 weeks (phased with parallel development tracks)

**Current Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planning phase - comprehensive implementation plan defined
**Last Updated**: January 14, 2025

### Key Design Principles

Per [Agent-Workflow-GUI.md](Agent-Workflow-GUI.md), the GUI is a **thin native wrapper** that:
- Embeds and manages the existing WebUI (already functional with 23/162 E2E tests passing)
- Delegates all workflow functionality to the underlying WebUI
- Provides native OS integration (system tray, notifications, URL scheme handling)
- Bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for unified installation
- Maintains cross-platform consistency while respecting platform conventions

### Architecture Overview

**Component Separation:**
- **Electron GUI Shell**: Handles window management, native OS integrations, and WebUI process lifecycle
- **Embedded Chromium**: Provides browser automation capabilities for cloud agent integrations (Codex, etc.)
- **WebUI Process**: Existing SolidJS/SolidStart application serving the main UI (reused as-is)
  - **Key Optimization**: Runs via Electron's bundled Node.js using `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Eliminates need for separate Node.js installation (~50-80MB saved)
- **CLI Toolchain**: Complete set of `ah` commands bundled for installation
- **URL Scheme Handler**: Rust binary handling `agent-harbor://` protocol (shared with headless systems)

**Technology Stack:**
- **GUI Framework**: Electron (cross-platform with Chromium)
  - **Critical Rationale**: Browser automation capability required for cloud agent integrations
    - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) specs for Codex and other cloud platforms
    - Playwright automation requires stable Chromium binary (shipped with Electron)
    - Reduces browser compatibility issues on user machines
    - Enables headless/headful automation with persistent browser profiles
  - **Additional Benefits**:
    - Cross-platform consistency (single codebase for macOS/Windows/Linux)
    - Rich ecosystem for native integrations
    - Well-established packaging and distribution patterns
- **WebUI Embedding**: Electron BrowserWindow loading `http://localhost:PORT` from WebUI process
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright with Electron's Chromium for cloud agent workflows
- **Process Management**: Rust crates for WebUI process lifecycle, packaged as native Node addons
- **Native Extensions**: Small CLI helpers or native Electron modules for system-specific functions
- **URL Handler**: Rust binary per [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### Parallel Development Tracks

Once foundation is established (M0-M1), multiple tracks can proceed in parallel:

- **macOS Native Track**: AppKit/SwiftUI host application with WKWebView embedding
- **Cross-Platform WebUI Track**: Continue WebUI development (ongoing in parallel)
- **CLI Bundling Track**: Packaging and PATH integration for bundled CLI tools
- **URL Scheme Track**: Protocol handler implementation (see [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md))
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Native UI testing framework setup

**M0.2.5 WebUI Embedding Strategy Evaluation** (1 week, depends on M0.2)

- **Deliverables**:

  **Evaluate Two Approaches for WebUI Integration:**

  1. **Static Build Approach (CSR)** - See [SolidStart-for-Electron.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/SolidStart-for-Electron.md)
     - Build SolidStart with `server: { preset: "static" }` configuration
     - Produces static files in `.output/public/` (HTML, JS, CSS)
     - Load static `index.html` directly in Electron renderer via `file://` protocol
     - WebUI communicates directly with REST API at `/api/v1` endpoints
     - **Pros**:
       - Simpler architecture (no separate Node.js server process)
       - Faster startup (no WebUI health check required)
       - Smaller memory footprint (no server process)
       - No port management or conflict detection needed
     - **Cons**:
       - Requires CORS configuration on REST API to allow renderer origin
       - May complicate future SSR requirements
       - Client-side routing needs history-fallback handling (use electron-serve)

  2. **Server Process Approach (SSR)** - Current plan in M0.3
     - Run SolidStart as Node.js server process via `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
     - Bundled WebUI server files in `resources/webui/`
     - BrowserWindow loads from `http://localhost:PORT`
     - **Pros**:
       - Preserves SSR capabilities if needed in future
       - Reuses our standard server SolidStart deployment (no build changes)
       - Familiar localhost development pattern
     - **Cons**:
       - More complex architecture (process lifecycle management)
       - Slower startup (health check required)
       - Port management and conflict detection needed
       - Higher memory footprint (~50MB server process)

  **PoC Implementation:**
  - Implement both approaches in minimal Electron prototypes
  - Test SolidStart static build configuration with vite-plugin-electron
  - Verify CORS requirements for static build communicating with REST API
  - Measure implementation complexity

  **Architecture Decision Document:**

### Risks & Mitigations

**Browser Automation Stability:**
- Risk: Cloud platform UI changes break automation
- Mitigation: Use stable selectors (role/aria); fail fast with diagnostics; screenshot on error; version-specific selector strategies

**Chromium Version Compatibility:**
- Risk: Electron's Chromium version differs from Playwright expectations
- Mitigation: Use Playwright's chromium channel matching Electron version; test automation against Electron's Chromium in CI

**Code Signing Complexity:**
- Risk: Signing workflows differ significantly across platforms
- Mitigation: Detailed documentation in [Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md); automate in CI; use GitHub Secrets for credentials

**Update Mechanism Reliability:**
- Risk: Auto-updates fail and leave app in broken state
- Mitigation: Implement robust rollback mechanism; extensive testing; phased rollout

**URL Scheme Security:**
- Risk: Malicious URLs exploit GUI or WebUI
- Mitigation: Strict input validation; confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions; security audit

**Performance Overhead:**
- Risk: Electron + WebUI + Browser automation create large application footprint
- Mitigation: Code splitting; lazy-load automation code; asar compression; performance benchmarking

**Electron Application Size:**
- Risk: Bundled Chromium makes installer large (150-200MB+)
- Mitigation:
  - Reuse Electron's Node.js for WebUI server (saves ~50-80MB by not bundling separate Node.js)
  - Document download size clearly
  - Delta updates for subsequent releases
  - Consider separate "lite" version without automation

**ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE Compatibility:**
- Risk: WebUI server may not run correctly under Electron's Node.js
- Mitigation:
  - Test WebUI server thoroughly with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Electron's Node.js is mostly compatible, differences mainly in crypto/OpenSSL
  - Fall back to bundled standalone Node.js if compatibility issues arise
  - See [Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md) for details

- WebUI continues independent development with E2E test suite
- GUI consumes WebUI as HTTP server on localhost
- No changes required to WebUI for GUI embedding

**CLI Integration:**
- Bundles all CLI binaries from Rust workspace
- Shares configuration files (`~/.config/agent-harbor/` or `AH_HOME`)
- CLI and GUI coordinate via shared state files
- URL handler binary shared between headless and GUI modes

**URL Scheme Integration:**
- Implements [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.md](Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.md) specification
- Electron's built-in protocol handling APIs
- electron-builder configures protocol registration in installers
- Single-instance lock prevents multiple GUI instances

**Browser Automation Integration:**
- Implements [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) specifications
- Playwright uses Electron's bundled Chromium
- Agent browser profiles stored in user data directory
- IPC API exposes automation to WebUI and CLI

**System Extension Integration (macOS):**

### Notes on Electron Decision

**Why Electron:**
- **Browser Automation is Critical**: Cloud agent support requires reliable browser automation
  - Codex, Claude, and other cloud platforms need programmatic interaction
  - Playwright requires stable Chromium binary for consistent automation
  - Electron ships with Chromium, reducing user-side browser compatibility issues
  - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) for detailed automation requirements
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Single codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Mature tooling for native integrations (notifications, tray, protocols)
- **Well-Established Patterns**: electron-builder provides proven packaging and distribution

**macOS System Extension Integration:**
- Electron GUI and native `apps/macos/AgentHarbor/` host app coexist as separate applications
- System extension remains in native AppKit/SwiftUI host (required by Apple)
- Electron GUI can communicate with system extension via IPC when available
- Both apps can be distributed together or independently

**Trade-offs:**
- **Application Size**: Electron apps are larger (150-200MB) due to bundled Chromium
  - Mitigation: Document download size; delta updates; consider compression
- **Memory Footprint**: Chromium process uses more memory than native web views
  - Mitigation: Performance monitoring; meet defined targets (< 150MB at idle)
- **Native Feel**: May not feel as native as platform-specific UIs
  - Mitigation: Use native window chrome where appropriate; follow platform conventions

**Alternative Considered: Tauri**
- Tauri uses system web views (WebKit/WebView2) instead of bundled Chromium
- **Rejected** because: System web views don't provide reliable automation environment
  - Browser automation requires consistent Chromium version
  - System WebKit/WebView2 versions vary across user machines
  - Playwright automation targets specific Chromium versions
