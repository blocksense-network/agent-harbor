### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status and plan for the Agent Harbor GUI, a cross-platform native desktop application that provides a graphical interface wrapper around the `ah webui` process with native desktop integrations.

Goal: deliver a production-ready cross-platform desktop application (macOS, Windows, Linux) that embeds the WebUI, handles the `agent-harbor://` URL scheme, provides native system integrations (tray, notifications), and bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for seamless installation.

Total estimated timeline: 17-21 weeks (phased with parallel development tracks)

**Current Status**: ðŸš§ Phase 0 Complete - Foundation established, moving to Phase 1 (Core GUI)
**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

### Key Design Principles

Per [Agent-Harbor-GUI.md](Agent-Harbor-GUI.md), the GUI is a **thin native wrapper** that:

- Embeds and manages the existing WebUI (already functional with 23/162 E2E tests passing)
- Delegates all workflow functionality to the underlying WebUI
- Provides native OS integration (system tray, notifications, URL scheme handling)
- Bundles the complete AH CLI toolchain for unified installation
- Maintains cross-platform consistency while respecting platform conventions

### Architecture Overview

**Component Separation:**

- **Electron GUI Shell**: Handles window management, native OS integrations, and WebUI process lifecycle
- **Embedded Chromium**: Provides browser automation capabilities for cloud agent integrations (Codex, etc.)
- **WebUI Process**: Existing SolidJS/SolidStart application serving the main UI (reused as-is)
  - **Key Optimization**: Runs via Electron's bundled Node.js using `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Eliminates need for separate Node.js installation (~50-80MB saved)
- **CLI Toolchain**: Complete set of `ah` commands bundled for installation
- **URL Scheme Handler**: Rust binary handling `agent-harbor://` protocol (shared with headless systems)

**Technology Stack:**

- **GUI Framework**: Electron (cross-platform with Chromium)
  - **Critical Rationale**: Browser automation capability required for cloud agent integrations
    - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) specs for Codex and other cloud platforms
    - Playwright automation requires stable Chromium binary (shipped with Electron)
    - Reduces browser compatibility issues on user machines
    - Enables headless/headful automation with persistent browser profiles
  - **Additional Benefits**:
    - Cross-platform consistency (single codebase for macOS/Windows/Linux)
    - Rich ecosystem for native integrations
    - Well-established packaging and distribution patterns
- **WebUI Embedding**: Electron BrowserWindow loading `http://localhost:PORT` from WebUI process
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright with Electron's Chromium for cloud agent workflows
- **Process Management**: Rust crates for WebUI process lifecycle, packaged as native Node addons
- **Native Extensions**: Small CLI helpers or native Electron modules for system-specific functions
- **URL Handler**: Rust binary per [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### Parallel Development Tracks

Once foundation is established (M0-M1), multiple tracks can proceed in parallel:

- **macOS Native Track**: AppKit/SwiftUI host application with WKWebView embedding
- **Cross-Platform WebUI Track**: Continue WebUI development (ongoing in parallel)
- **CLI Bundling Track**: Packaging and PATH integration for bundled CLI tools
- **URL Scheme Track**: Protocol handler implementation (see [Handling-AH-URL-Scheme.status.md](Handling-AW-URL-Scheme.status.md))
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Native UI testing framework setup

**M0.2.5 WebUI Embedding Strategy Evaluation** âœ… **COMPLETED** (1 week, depends on M0.2)

- **Deliverables**:

  **Evaluate WebUI Integration Approaches:**

  **Architecture Investigation:**
  - Evaluated SolidStart SSR vs CSR builds for Electron embedding
  - Discovered SolidStart's file-based routing incompatibility with pure CSR
  - Identified "use server" directives as key difference between SSR/CSR modes
  - Validated that REST API fetch logic is 99% identical between modes
  - Confirmed static build viability for production use

  **Final Architecture Decision:**
  - **Selected Approach**: Static CSR build served via `ah webui` subprocess
  - **Electron BrowserWindow loads from `http://localhost:PORT`**
  - **`ah webui` serves both static files AND REST API** on single port
  - **Static files bundled with `ah` CLI binary** (compressed archive)

  **Key Benefits:**
  1. **Unified Architecture**: Same `ah webui` command for both CLI and Electron use cases
  2. **Resource Efficiency**: Static CSR build minimizes runtime overhead (no SSR)
  3. **Simplified Testing**: Mock REST server can serve static files for Electron tests
  4. **Code Reuse**: Single WebUI codebase, shared REST service implementation
  5. **Clean Separation**: Electron handles UI chrome, `ah webui` handles application logic

  **Investigation Outcomes:**
  - CSR/SSR dual-build feasibility validated with 99% code reuse in data-fetching layer
  - Manual routing proved necessary for CSR-only builds (FileRoutes requires SSR infrastructure)
  - Static embedding prototype validated CSR compatibility but rejected due to maintenance burden
  - Performance characteristics measured: Startup < 500ms, Memory < 100MB for static build

- **Verification Results**:
  - [x] Both PoCs implemented and functional
  - [x] Static build approach fully documented with pros/cons
  - [x] Subprocess delegation approach fully documented
  - [x] Performance characteristics measured and documented
  - [x] **Playwright browser version compatibility fixed**: Upgraded to 1.54.2 (chromium-1181)
  - [x] **Yarn PnP re-enabled**: Development environment uses PnP for module resolution
  - [x] **SSR workflows preserved and verified**: `just webui-test` passing (API + E2E tests)
  - [x] **Architecture decision finalized**: Subprocess delegation selected
  - [x] Investigation artifacts cleaned up (prototypes and CSR-specific code removed)

**M0.3 Mock API Server Extension for Static Build** âœ… **COMPLETED** (1 week, depends on M0.2.5)

- **Overview**: Extended the existing mock REST server (used for WebUI E2E tests) to serve static CSR build files, enabling Electron integration testing without the full `ah` CLI.

- **Deliverables**:
  - âœ… Mock server serves static files from `webui/app/dist/client/` directory
  - âœ… Static file serving middleware integrated with existing API routes
  - âœ… Build automation: CSR build triggered before Electron tests
  - âœ… Playwright tests verify Electron loads and renders WebUI from mock server
  - âœ… Manual testing command: `just manual-test-electron` launches Electron with mock server

- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - **Mock Server Extension** (`webui/mock-server/src/index.ts`):
    - âœ… Added static file serving middleware (`express.static()`)
    - âœ… Serves files from `../app/dist/client/` directory
    - âœ… SPA fallback routing (serve `index.html` on all non-API routes)
    - âœ… Existing REST API routes unchanged (`/api/v1/*`)

  - **Build Pipeline Integration**:
    - âœ… CSR build script: `webui/app/scripts/build-csr.sh`
    - âœ… Automatic CSR build before Electron tests (`pretest` script)
    - âœ… Just command: `just webui-build-csr` for explicit CSR builds

  - **Electron Integration** (`electron-app/src/main/index.ts`):
    - âœ… Loads `http://localhost:3001` (mock server port) in development
    - âœ… Error handling for failed WebUI loads
    - âœ… Window state persistence via electron-store

  - **Testing**:
    - âœ… Playwright tests: `electron-app/tests/static-integration.spec.ts` and `basic.spec.ts`
    - âœ… Verified: Window opens, WebUI loads, dashboard renders, API calls work
    - âœ… All tests pass (9/9) against mock server serving static build + API

  - **Manual Testing**:
    - âœ… `just manual-test-electron`: Builds CSR, starts mock server, launches Electron
    - âœ… Developer can interact with GUI to verify functionality

- **Key Source Files**:
  - `webui/mock-server/src/index.ts` - Static file serving implementation
  - `webui/app/scripts/build-csr.sh` - CSR build script with manifest handling
  - `electron-app/src/main/index.ts` - Electron main process with WebUI loading
  - `electron-app/src/renderer/preload.ts` - Preload script with agentHarborConfig

  - `Justfile` - Build and test automation targets

- **Implementation Details**:

  **CSR/SSR Route Separation:**
  - âœ… Implemented dual-route architecture: `index.csr.tsx` (CSR) and `index.ssr.tsx` (SSR)
  - âœ… Build script temporarily replaces `index.tsx` with CSR version during static builds
  - âœ… CSR routes use direct API client calls (`apiClient.listSessions()`, `apiClient.listDrafts()`)
  - âœ… SSR routes use server functions with `'use server'` directives
  - âœ… Clean separation allows 99% code reuse between modes

  **Yarn PnP + Electron Integration:**
  - âœ… Resolved PnP compatibility issues with vite-plugin-electron
  - âœ… Created `launch-electron.mjs` helper to resolve Electron binary through PnP
  - âœ… Launches Electron directly without `yarn electron` to avoid PnP path resolution
  - âœ… Native addon copied to `dist-electron/node_modules/` for Playwright tests
  - âœ… Script: `electron-app/scripts/copy-native-addon.sh` handles addon files

  **CSR Build Pipeline:**
  - âœ… Manifest transformation: Vite manifest â†’ client-expected format
  - âœ… Dynamic `index.html` generation with correct asset hashes
  - âœ… External `manifest.js` file to avoid CSP inline script issues
  - âœ… Automatic cleanup of stale files (`rm -rf dist/client` before build)

  **Electron Configuration:**
  - âœ… Disabled vite-plugin-electron renderer build (not needed - loads from server)
  - âœ… Modified `build:dev` script to ignore renderer build errors
  - âœ… Preload script exposes `window.agentHarborConfig` for WebUI
  - âœ… Window state persistence with electron-store

  **Test Infrastructure:**
  - âœ… Mock server startup/shutdown in test beforeAll/afterAll hooks
  - âœ… Health check polling before Electron launch (no blind sleeps)
  - âœ… Proper PnP-aware Electron executable resolution
  - âœ… Error logging and screenshot capture on failures

- **Key Architectural Decisions**:
  - **Static Build Strategy**: CSR build served by mock server validates the subprocess delegation architecture
  - **Route Separation**: Clean separation between CSR and SSR routes enables code reuse while avoiding SolidStart limitations
  - **PnP Compatibility**: Custom launch script resolves Yarn PnP + Electron conflicts elegantly
  - **Test-First Approach**: 9 comprehensive Playwright tests ensure reliability

- **Verification Results**:
  - [x] Mock server serves static files from `dist/client/` correctly
  - [x] SPA fallback routing works (all routes serve `index.html`) - Fixed for Express 5

  - [x] Development workflow: `just manual-test-electron` launches complete stack
  - [x] Cross-platform foundation established (tested on macOS, PnP solution portable)

- **Performance Characteristics** (measured on macOS):
  - Application startup: < 1s from launch to window display
  - WebUI ready: < 2s after mock server starts
  - Memory footprint: ~120MB at idle (Electron + WebUI + mock server)
  - Test suite execution: 9 tests in ~12-13 seconds

- **Documentation**:

### Risks & Mitigations

**Browser Automation Stability:**

- Risk: Cloud platform UI changes break automation
- Mitigation: Use stable selectors (role/aria); fail fast with diagnostics; screenshot on error; version-specific selector strategies

**Chromium Version Compatibility:**

- Risk: Electron's Chromium version differs from Playwright expectations
- Mitigation: Use Playwright's chromium channel matching Electron version; test automation against Electron's Chromium in CI

**Code Signing Complexity:**

- Risk: Signing workflows differ significantly across platforms
- Mitigation: Detailed documentation in [Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Agent-Harbor-Electron-Packaging.md); automate in CI; use GitHub Secrets for credentials

**Update Mechanism Reliability:**

- Risk: Auto-updates fail and leave app in broken state
- Mitigation: Implement robust rollback mechanism; extensive testing; phased rollout

**URL Scheme Security:**

- Risk: Malicious URLs exploit GUI or WebUI
- Mitigation: Strict input validation; confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions; security audit

**Performance Overhead:**

- Risk: Electron + WebUI + Browser automation create large application footprint
- Mitigation: Code splitting; lazy-load automation code; asar compression; performance benchmarking

**Electron Application Size:**

- Risk: Bundled Chromium makes installer large (150-200MB+)
- Mitigation:
  - Reuse Electron's Node.js for WebUI server (saves ~50-80MB by not bundling separate Node.js)
  - Document download size clearly
  - Delta updates for subsequent releases
  - Consider separate "lite" version without automation

**ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE Compatibility:**

- Risk: WebUI server may not run correctly under Electron's Node.js
- Mitigation:
  - Test WebUI server thoroughly with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`
  - Electron's Node.js is mostly compatible, differences mainly in crypto/OpenSSL
  - Fall back to bundled standalone Node.js if compatibility issues arise
  - See [Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md](../../specs/Research/Electron-Packaging/Using-Electron-As-NodeJS.md) for details

- WebUI continues independent development with E2E test suite
- GUI consumes WebUI as HTTP server on localhost
- No changes required to WebUI for GUI embedding

**CLI Integration:**

- Bundles all CLI binaries from Rust workspace
- Shares configuration files (`~/.config/agent-harbor/` or `AH_HOME`)
- CLI and GUI coordinate via shared state files
- URL handler binary shared between headless and GUI modes

**URL Scheme Integration:**

### Notes on Electron Decision

**Why Electron:**

- **Browser Automation is Critical**: Cloud agent support requires reliable browser automation
  - Codex, Claude, and other cloud platforms need programmatic interaction
  - Playwright requires stable Chromium binary for consistent automation
  - Electron ships with Chromium, reducing user-side browser compatibility issues
  - See [Browser-Automation/](Browser-Automation/) for detailed automation requirements
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Single codebase for macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Mature tooling for native integrations (notifications, tray, protocols)
- **Well-Established Patterns**: electron-builder provides proven packaging and distribution

**macOS System Extension Integration:**

- Electron GUI and native `apps/macos/AgentHarbor/` host app coexist as separate applications
- System extension remains in native AppKit/SwiftUI host (required by Apple)
- Electron GUI can communicate with system extension via IPC when available
- Both apps can be distributed together or independently

**Trade-offs:**

- **Application Size**: Electron apps are larger (150-200MB) due to bundled Chromium
  - Mitigation: Document download size; delta updates; consider compression
- **Memory Footprint**: Chromium process uses more memory than native web views
  - Mitigation: Performance monitoring; meet defined targets (< 150MB at idle)
- **Native Feel**: May not feel as native as platform-specific UIs
  - Mitigation: Use native window chrome where appropriate; follow platform conventions

**Alternative Considered: Tauri**

- Tauri uses system web views (WebKit/WebView2) instead of bundled Chromium
- **Rejected** because: System web views don't provide reliable automation environment
  - Browser automation requires consistent Chromium version
  - System WebKit/WebView2 versions vary across user machines
  - Playwright automation targets specific Chromium versions
