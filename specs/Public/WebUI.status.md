### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the [WebUI-PRD.md](WebUI-PRD.md) functionality.

Goal: deliver a production-ready web-based dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing agent coding sessions with real-time visibility, seamless IDE integration, and comprehensive governance controls.

Total estimated timeline: 8-10 weeks (broken into major phases with parallel development tracks)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### WebUI Feature Set

The WebUI implementation provides these core capabilities:

- **Three-Pane Dashboard**: Repository navigation, chronological task feed, and detailed task view with live logs
- **Task Management**: Zero-friction task creation with policy-aware templates and validation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live session status, logs streaming via SSE, and event-driven updates
- **IDE Integration**: One-click launch helpers for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf pointing to active workspaces
- **Governance Controls**: Multi-tenant RBAC, audit trails, and resource management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-side rendering sidecar for users without JavaScript, ensuring core functionality works universally
- **Local Mode**: Zero-setup single-developer experience with localhost-only binding
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second initial load times and 300ms log latency targets

### Parallel Development Tracks

Multiple development tracks can proceed in parallel once the core infrastructure (W1-W1.5-W2) is established:

- **UI Components Track**: Build reusable SolidJS components for forms, tables, and real-time displays (continues from W3-W4)
- **API Integration Track**: Implement REST service client and SSE event handling (W2-W5)
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Develop Playwright E2E test suites and mock server utilities
- **Performance Track**: Optimize bundle size, loading times, and real-time performance
- **Accessibility Track**: Implement ARIA landmarks, keyboard navigation, and screen reader testing

### Approach

- **SolidJS + Tailwind CSS**: Modern reactive framework with utility-first styling for maintainable, performant UIs
- **Node.js SSR Sidecar**: Server-side rendering server that proxies requests to the Rust REST API and handles progressive enhancement for users without JavaScript (see [Server-Side-Rendering-with-SolidJS.md](../../Research/Server-Side-Rendering-with-SolidJS.md) for implementation guide)
- **Mock-First Development**: Start with comprehensive mock server implementing REST-Service.md for isolated development
- **Playwright Testing**: Fully automated E2E testing through pre-scripted scenarios that control both the mock REST server state and UI interactions, enabling deterministic testing of complete user journeys, accessibility compliance, and performance benchmarks
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript; real-time features enhance the experience
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, testable components with clear prop interfaces and TypeScript typing
- **Real-time UX**: SSE-driven updates with optimistic UI patterns for pause/stop/resume actions
- **Security-First**: Input validation, XSS prevention, and secure API communication patterns

### Test strategy & tooling

- **Playwright E2E Testing**: Primary testing approach with comprehensive coverage of user journeys, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility
- **Mock Server Development**: Start with full REST-Service.md mock implementation for isolated feature development
- **Component Testing**: Unit tests for reusable components with SolidJS testing library
- **Visual Testing**: Automated screenshot comparison for UI consistency across releases
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse CI integration with custom performance budgets
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated axe-core checks integrated into E2E test suite

### Deliverables

- Production-ready WebUI application built with SolidJS + Tailwind CSS
- Comprehensive mock server for development and testing
- Full Playwright test suite with CI integration
- Local mode for zero-setup single-developer usage
- Deployment guides and performance optimizations

### Risks & mitigations

- **Framework Maturity**: SolidJS is production-ready but less common than React; mitigated by thorough evaluation and fallback to React if issues arise
- **Real-time Complexity**: SSE implementation requires careful error handling; mitigated by robust reconnection logic and fallback to polling
- **Browser Compatibility**: WebUI targets modern browsers only; mitigated by clear browser support matrix and graceful degradation
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-2s TTI challenging with real-time features; mitigated by code splitting, lazy loading, and performance budgeting
- **Mock vs Real API**: Initial development with mocks risks integration issues; mitigated by mock server implementing full REST-Service.md spec
