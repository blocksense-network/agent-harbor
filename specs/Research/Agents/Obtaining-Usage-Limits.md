# Programmatic Retrieval of AI Tool Usage Limits

In this report, we detail how to programmatically obtain the current usage state (session limits, weekly/monthly quotas, etc.) for several popular AI coding assistant tools that operate on subscription plans with usage limits. Each section outlines the specific methods (including reverse-engineering approaches where necessary) to retrieve usage data for a given tool, providing enough technical detail for a developer to implement a solution without further external lookup.

## Anthropic Claude Code (Pro/Max Plans)

**Usage Limits Overview:** Claude Code (Anthropic’s agentic coding assistant) enforces a rolling **5-hour session** limit (number of messages or coding actions) and separate **weekly caps (7-day window)** on usage[\[1\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=In%20mid,purchase%20additional%20capacity%20where%20offered)[\[2\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=2,limit%20%2F%20reset%20at%207pm%E2%80%9D). For example, the $20/month **Pro** plan allows roughly 45 Claude messages (or \~10–40 code actions) per 5-hour session, whereas the $100/month **Max 5×** plan allows \~225 messages (or \~50–200 code actions) per session[\[3\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=Pro%20plan%20). Weekly limits also apply (e.g. \~40–80 hours of Claude Code usage per week on Pro) and are higher on Max plans[\[3\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=Pro%20plan%20). Hitting a session cap triggers a cooldown until the 5-hour window resets, while exhausting a weekly cap prevents further use until the 7-day period resets[\[4\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=weekly%20caps%20are%20separate%20from,purchase%20additional%20capacity%20where%20offered)[\[5\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=3,Opus%2Fmodel%20cap).

**Programmatic Usage Retrieval:** Anthropic provides an **official Claude Code CLI** which includes built-in commands to check usage. In an interactive Claude Code CLI session, you can invoke the slash command /usage to **display your plan’s usage status and limits**[\[6\]](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#:~:text=%60%2Fsecurity,subscription%20plans%20only). This will show remaining quota in the current session window and indicate any rate-limit status or upcoming reset time. For example, running /usage in the CLI might report how many messages or hours remain in your 5-hour allotment and how close you are to the weekly cap. The CLI also supports a /statusline feature to continuously show usage stats in your shell prompt (configurable via \~/.claude/settings.json)[\[7\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=3,statusline%20integration%20for%20local%20tooling).

Under the hood, the Claude CLI obtains this information by tracking your usage against known plan limits and via server feedback. When using Claude via the API, Anthropic includes response headers (e.g. anthropic-ratelimit-requests-remaining, anthropic-ratelimit-\*-reset) on hitting limits[\[8\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=For%20API%20consumers%20and%20organization,you%20can%20resume%20heavy%20activity)[\[9\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=,for%20exact%20scheduling%20of%20retries). However, for the chat/CLI interface, the /usage command is the direct way to get real-time usage metrics. A developer can automate this by spawning the Claude CLI in a subprocess and programmatically sending the /usage command (e.g. using claude \-p "/usage" with JSON output flags for easy parsing). This will return structured data or text indicating current usage.

**Alternate Methods:** If using Claude via the web interface (claude.ai), note that the UI itself will show a warning when you’re _“approaching the 5-hour limit”_ with a reset time estimate[\[2\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=2,limit%20%2F%20reset%20at%207pm%E2%80%9D). Programmatically scraping that from the web UI is possible but not as straightforward as using the CLI. For organizational users (Team/Enterprise plans), Anthropic offers an **Admin Usage Report API** that can return per-day Claude Code usage metrics[\[10\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=2%29%20Check%20usage%20programmatically%20%28organization,cURL). This requires an admin API key and is mainly for org-wide tracking (not available to individual Pro/Max users)[\[11\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=Anthropic%20exposes%20an%20Admin%20%E2%80%9CUsage,Example%20%28edited%20for%20clarity). In summary, for an individual developer, the most practical approach is leveraging the Claude Code CLI’s /usage output[\[6\]](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#:~:text=%60%2Fsecurity,subscription%20plans%20only).

## OpenAI Codex CLI (ChatGPT Plus/Pro Coding Assistant)

**Usage Limits Overview:** OpenAI’s Codex (now essentially the code-centric mode of GPT-5) is offered through ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans, with enforced usage quotas similar to ChatGPT’s message limits. Specifically, ChatGPT **Plus** subscribers using Codex are limited to roughly _“45–225 local messages or 10–60 cloud tasks every 5 hours, with a shared weekly limit,”_ according to OpenAI’s documentation[\[12\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=Plus)[\[13\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=,message%20capacity%20by%20about%204x). The higher-tier **Pro** plan increases these limits \~10–20× (e.g. \~300–1500 messages per 5h)[\[14\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=Pro). In practice, Plus users have reported hitting the 5-hour limit after as few as \~30 code generations and the weekly limit after a couple of days of heavy use[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=30%20messages%20per%205%20hours,at%20least%202000%20per%20day)[\[16\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=razekery). The Codex CLI will inform you when a limit is reached by printing an error and a timer until reset – for example: _“You’ve hit your usage limit. Upgrade to Pro or try again in 4 days 5 hours 31 minutes.”_[\[17\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=i%20think%20they%20are%20giving,but). This message indicates the weekly cap was exhausted (in this case requiring a 5-day wait) and is the same mechanism by which the VS Code Codex extension reports limits[\[18\]](https://x.com/i/status/1968014910560014453#:~:text=Strange,in%202%20days%2027%20minutes).

**Programmatic Usage Retrieval:** Unlike Claude, OpenAI’s Codex CLI does **not have an obvious built-in command to query remaining quota**. The official help docs note that _“Codex usage, when used on the web or delegated to the cloud, is available in the Compliance API... Usage in local environments is not available.”_[\[19\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=Data%20residency%20and%20Compliance%20API). This means there is no publicly documented API endpoint to fetch how much of your Codex allowance is left for Plus/Pro users. In practice, the Codex CLI itself internally tracks your usage and receives limit info from the server. As a developer, one way to get the usage state is to **parse the CLI’s output** or logs. For instance, each time you run a Codex CLI command, it may output a percentage of your 5-hour or weekly quota used. Users have observed the CLI showing messages like “5-hour limit dropped from 100% to 0%” and weekly usage percentages[\[20\]](https://community.openai.com/t/are-codex-pro-limits-now-stricter-after-the-recent-update-too/1364809#:~:text=Pro%20plan%3A%20hit%205,today%E2%80%99s%20update%20%20%203), implying the CLI receives updates about remaining quota. By running a trivial Codex command (e.g. a no-op code request) and capturing stdout/stderr, you might extract lines indicating current usage percent or time to reset.

In cases where the CLI does not explicitly print usage until you hit a limit, a more hacky approach is intercepting the network calls. The Codex CLI uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT authentication and likely calls the same backend that enforces limits. You could run the CLI with verbose logging (\--verbose) to see if it returns any headers or JSON including usage info. If the CLI uses the ChatGPT web API, you might also attempt to call the **ChatGPT Compliance API** (intended for enterprise auditing) to see conversation metadata that includes token usage[\[21\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=Data%20residency%20and%20Compliance%20API), though this may require business-tier credentials.

**Reverse-Engineering Tip:** The local config file \~/.codex/config.toml may hold clues about authentication and mode (API key vs subscription)[\[22\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=Reasoning%20effort%20in%20,to%20LOW%20the%20entire%20time) but not the live usage counters. The most reliable trigger is the CLI’s limit error itself. By programmatically catching the "You've hit your usage limit..." exception message, you can determine that the quota is exhausted and even parse the reset timestamp from the message[\[17\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=i%20think%20they%20are%20giving,but). In summary, **OpenAI currently provides no official usage-fetch API for Codex-ChatGPT subscriptions**, so a developer must rely on **parsing CLI outputs or error messages** to gauge usage. Keep in mind that usage resets (5-hour window or weekly) are rolling, and the CLI’s messages will give the next reset time down to the minute, which you can parse into a timer.

## Cursor (Anysphere Cursor IDE)

**Usage Limits Overview:** Cursor is a specialized AI-enabled code editor that offers subscription tiers (**Pro**, **Ultra**, etc.) with a mix of unlimited basic features and monthly credits for advanced model usage. As of mid-2025, the **Cursor Pro plan ($20/mo)** includes _“unlimited usage”_ of certain built-in models (labeled _Auto_ mode which uses cheaper/faster models), plus **$20 worth of “frontier” model usage per month** (these are calls to more expensive models like Claude-4 or GPT-4, metered at API rates)[\[23\]](https://cursor.com/blog/june-2025-pricing#:~:text=The%20new%20Cursor%20Pro%20plan,gives%20you). In other words, Pro users get a monthly token/credit pool equivalent to $20 of API calls to premium models; once this is consumed, you either experience reduced functionality or need to pay for additional usage. (Cursor allows a grace overage beyond exactly $20, and also offers an option to enable pay-as-you-go once the included credits are exhausted[\[24\]](https://cursor.com/blog/june-2025-pricing#:~:text=We%20previously%20described%20our%20included,period%20beyond%20the%20credit%20pool).) The **Ultra plan** and team plans provide higher or shared credit limits. Cursor switched to this credit-based system from an earlier fixed-request model (formerly 500 requests/mo)[\[25\]](https://cursor.com/blog/june-2025-pricing#:~:text=Cursor%20uses%20a%20combination%20of,Sonnet%20models%20costing%20two%20requests), so now usage is measured in **tokens/dollars rather than count of prompts**.

**Programmatic Usage Retrieval:** Cursor provides a **web dashboard** and in-app indicators for usage. You can check your current token consumption by going to **Dashboard → Usage** in the Cursor app, which shows how much of your monthly credit you’ve used (and the billing page shows any overages)[\[26\]](https://forum.cursor.com/t/monthly-token-limit-in-the-20-pro-plan-for-cursor-usage/120655#:~:text=Tokens%20are%20used%20every%20time,Tokens%20are%20divided%20into%E2%80%A6). To obtain this programmatically, you can leverage Cursor’s API or web requests used by that dashboard. Cursor’s app likely uses an authentication token (stored after login) to call an endpoint (possibly a REST or GraphQL API) that returns usage stats. While Cursor’s public documentation doesn’t expose a standalone usage API, one approach is to use the developer console or a network proxy while viewing the **Cursor Dashboard** to find the relevant request. For example, it might be a GraphQL query for userUsage or an HTTP GET to an endpoint like <https://api.cursor.com/v1/usage> (this is hypothetical). Once identified, you can replicate this call in code by including the same auth token (Cursor may store JWT tokens in a config file or browser local storage).

Another strategy is to use Cursor’s **CLI or SDK** if available. Cursor has a CLI tool for certain operations[\[27\]](https://cursor.com/blog/june-2025-pricing#:~:text=,3), but usage querying isn’t clearly documented. However, since Cursor is an Electron app, its user data (on disk) might include the current usage state. In absence of an official API, **scraping the usage from the app GUI** is feasible: for example, automating the app or using Browser DevTools protocol to load the dashboard page headlessly and parse the usage progress bar.

**Usage Notifications:** Note that Cursor also **notifies the user in the chat interface when they are approaching their limit**. From version 1.2.4 onward, if you are a Pro user, the assistant message will say something like _“You are projected to reach your usage limits by July 12, 2025 based on current usage.”_[\[28\]](https://forum.cursor.com/t/monthly-token-limit-in-the-20-pro-plan-for-cursor-usage/120655#:~:text=As%20there%20is%20no%20simple,model%2C%20please%20use%20following%20info)[\[29\]](https://forum.cursor.com/t/monthly-token-limit-in-the-20-pro-plan-for-cursor-usage/120655#:~:text=Hi%20%40CodingAI%20Cursor%201,per%20user%20and%20their%20usage). This includes an approximate date when your included credits will run out. A developer could exploit this by programmatically reading the assistant’s system messages in Cursor (if such access is possible via an extension or script) to get a sense of usage remaining. However, the more precise method is calling the underlying usage data as described. In summary, **to implement a usage checker for Cursor**, you would log in programmatically and call the same internal API the Cursor dashboard uses to fetch usage, parsing out the remaining credit or tokens this month. All needed info (total included $ credit and amount used so far) is provided in that data, allowing you to calculate what’s left.

## Replit Ghostwriter (Replit AI Assistant)

**Usage Limits Overview:** Replit’s Ghostwriter (AI code assistant and “Agent”) is offered as part of Replit’s paid plans (e.g. the **Core plan** \~$20/mo). Replit uses a **usage-based billing** model: subscribers get a certain amount of AI credits each month included, and beyond that, additional usage is charged. As of 2025, Replit Core includes about **$25 of AI credit per month** (exact figure not explicitly in docs above, but implied by “All subscribers receive… Additional monthly credits…”[\[30\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=Getting%20started)). These credits are consumed by Ghostwriter’s actions – either **Assistant** prompts or **Agent** coding tasks – based on token counts and complexity. Replit’s system is quite granular: for example, each Ghostwriter **“edit” or agent “checkpoint”** has an associated cost in credits (effort-based pricing)[\[31\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=Image%3A%20Replit%20Agent%20interface%20showing,chat%20and%20checkpoint%20system)[\[32\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=How%20effort). Once the included credits are used up, the user can either purchase more or the usage will start incurring charges (if a payment method is on file) with an optional spend limit. There is no fixed “message cap”, but effectively a **monthly credit limit** that resets each billing cycle.

**Programmatic Usage Retrieval:** Replit provides an **advanced usage dashboard** in your account settings, which updates in near real-time. According to Replit’s docs, you can _“see detailed billing information for the current period”_ on the **Usage dashboard** and even set up alerts and budgets[\[33\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=Track%20your%20usage)[\[34\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=Managing%20your%20spend). The usage dashboard is accessible via the web (for a logged-in user, visiting <https://replit.com/usage>). To retrieve this data programmatically, you can use Replit’s GraphQL API, which the web dashboard likely calls. Replit’s internal APIs are GraphQL-based; once authenticated (Replit supports login via an API token or cookie), you can query for usage stats. Replit’s documentation hints at a Data API and mentions that the usage dashboard shows AI usage costs[\[35\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=You%20can%20monitor%20your%20Agent,time) – it’s reasonable to assume a GraphQL query exists for “current AI usage” or similar.

A potential implementation: use Replit’s OAuth or personal API token to authenticate, then issue a GraphQL query for your usage. If an official query isn’t documented, you can inspect the network calls your browser makes on the usage page. For example, after logging in to replit.com, opening dev tools and filtering for “usage” or “credit” in network requests can reveal an endpoint. Replit often uses endpoints like <https://replit.com/graphql> with a query name such as getUserUsage. The response should include how many AI credits have been spent in the current cycle and how many were provided. With that information, your script can compute remaining credits.

**Alternative:** If GraphQL is cumbersome, Replit also allows exporting usage data via their APIs or setting **usage alerts**[\[34\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=Managing%20your%20spend). You could set a low spend alert (say when 50% of credits are used) and use Replit’s email/webhook as a trigger, but that’s indirect. For an immediate reading, calling the usage API is preferred. In summary, by authenticating with your Replit account and querying the usage/billing endpoint, you can programmatically obtain Ghostwriter’s current monthly usage and remaining credits. This approach does not require reverse engineering beyond observing the web request pattern, as Replit is developer-friendly and likely to use accessible API calls under the hood.

## Other Tools and Considerations

**Phind** – Phind’s developer search assistant offers a Pro plan (around $17–20/mo) that unlocks more frequent usage (e.g. significantly higher daily query limits, access to GPT-4/Claude models, etc.)[\[36\]](https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/Phind-AI-The-Developer's-Answer-Engine-In-Depth/1972848544815181824#:~:text=Phind%20AI%3A%20The%20Developer%27s%20Answer,of%20premium%20queries%20daily)[\[37\]](https://findmyaitool.io/tool/phind/#:~:text=Phind%20Review%3A%20Features%2C%20Pricing%2C%20and,monthly%20billing). Free users have a daily query cap (often cited as \~50 queries/day), while Pro users get “500+ queries per day” (effectively almost unlimited for normal use)[\[38\]](https://www.genspark.ai/spark/daily-free-usage-limits-for-phind-com/667c52d1-ea58-4d7f-9069-43b64dac567c#:~:text=Daily%20Free%20Usage%20Limits%20for,queries%20per%20day%2C%20depending). Phind’s web interface shows a counter for free-tier queries used, but Pro largely removes this cap. If needed, one could scrape the query counter from the Phind interface for free accounts; for Pro, since limits are high, the site may not actively display usage. Phind does not provide a public API for search usage counts, so any programmatic check would involve **parsing the Phind web UI** (e.g. the usage bar that might appear for free users).

**GitHub Copilot** – GitHub Copilot is a subscription service ($10/mo or enterprise) but notably **does not impose explicit usage quotas** on a per-month basis. It uses underlying OpenAI models with certain request rate limits, but from the user perspective Copilot is “unlimited” within fair-use. There is no user-facing meter to query, and no API to get usage. (Enterprise admins can view overall usage analytics on the dashboard, but that’s outside the scope of individual usage checks.) If needed, one could monitor the IDE plugin logs for any rate-limit messages, but there’s no documented programmatic usage report for Copilot.

**Amazon CodeWhisperer** – Included for completeness, Amazon’s CodeWhisperer is free for individual use without significant limits (it used to have 50 requests/day in preview, but as of 2023 it became generally available with unlimited coding queries for individuals[\[39\]](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/amazon-codewhisperer-gains-an-enterprise-tier/#:~:text=Amazon%20CodeWhisperer%20gains%20an%20enterprise,developers%20without%20any%20usage%20restrictions)). It only limits the number of **security scans** (e.g. 50 scans/month on free tier)[\[40\]](https://thiagoalves.ai/first-impressions-of-amazon-codewhisperer/#:~:text=First%20impressions%20of%20Amazon%20CodeWhisperer,and%20provides%20suggestions%20for). There isn’t a need to fetch “remaining completions” for CodeWhisperer since standard code suggestions are unlimited for authenticated users. Enterprise tiers have usage integrated with AWS billing, which can be tracked via AWS CloudWatch metrics rather than a simple API call.

**In summary**, for each tool that has subscription usage limits, there is a method to retrieve the current usage programmatically:

- **Claude Code (Anthropic)** – Use the official CLI’s /usage command to get remaining messages/hours in the session and week[\[6\]](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands#:~:text=%60%2Fsecurity,subscription%20plans%20only). This provides a direct readout of your usage. Alternatively, parse the Claude web/CLI warnings or use the Admin usage API if you have an org admin key[\[41\]](https://www.cometapi.com/when-does-claude-code-usage-reset/#:~:text=2%29%20Check%20usage%20programmatically%20%28organization,cURL).

- **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro)** – No direct API, so intercept the CLI behaviors. Monitor CLI outputs or error messages for usage info (e.g. catch the “limit reached, resets in X hours” message[\[17\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1n2b19e/whats_codex_cli_weekly_limit_and_how_to_check_it/#:~:text=i%20think%20they%20are%20giving,but)). You may also attempt to call ChatGPT’s hidden compliance API for conversations, though that’s unofficial for Plus users[\[21\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-using-codex-with-your-chatgpt-plan#:~:text=Data%20residency%20and%20Compliance%20API).

- **Cursor** – Query the Cursor usage dashboard. By mimicking the web dashboard’s request (with your auth token), you can get the monthly token/credit usage. The app will also proactively tell you how long until you run out at your current pace[\[29\]](https://forum.cursor.com/t/monthly-token-limit-in-the-20-pro-plan-for-cursor-usage/120655#:~:text=Hi%20%40CodingAI%20Cursor%201,per%20user%20and%20their%20usage). Reverse-engineering the internal API (likely via network inspector) is the way to implement this.

- **Replit Ghostwriter** – Use Replit’s GraphQL API to fetch your AI usage/billing info. The usage dashboard data (current credits spent vs. provided) can be retrieved once authenticated[\[35\]](https://docs.replit.com/billing/ai-billing#:~:text=You%20can%20monitor%20your%20Agent,time). This gives an exact count of remaining AI credits for the month.

Each of these approaches can be implemented in code running on the user’s machine, since you can install the necessary CLI tools or send authenticated web requests as needed. Keep in mind that reverse-engineering private APIs may violate terms of service, so use official methods when possible (e.g. CLI commands or documented APIs). By following the techniques above, a developer can build a script to aggregate all their AI tool usage stats and avoid any surprises with hitting limits.
