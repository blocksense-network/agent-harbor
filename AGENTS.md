# Testing your changes

- You can execute the test suite with `just test`.
- You can lint the codebase with `just lint`.
  Don't disable lints just to make the linter happy. ALWAYS try to fix the code first.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Tips

When the test suite fails and you want to test potential fixes, try running only the affected
tests firsts:

`ruby -Itest test/test_file.rb -n test_method_name`

ALWAYS run testing commands with a suitable timeout because they might hang.

## Managing dependencies

The development environment of this project is managed in a nix flake at the root of the repo.
All development is expected to be done in a nix dev shell that can be entered with direnv.
The `just` command runner is configured to automatically execute all commands in the Nix dev shell.
Python packages are typically added to the Nix flake.
Node.js packages are managed with yarn in PnP mode. One exception is the Playwright package, for which we manage the browsers through the nix flake.
Rust packages are managed with Cargo, while Rust itself is pinned in the nix flake.
Feel free to add any additional software that is needed for the project goals by expanding the nix flake.
After adding new dependencies, always make sure that you are adding a recent version. You can run `just outdated` to search for outdated packages.
When you are facing issues with a dependency, make sure to study its implementation files that you can find in the local nix store, the local cargo cache, the local yarn cache, etc.

## Code quality guidelines

- ALWAYS strive to achieve high code quality.
- ALWAYS write secure code.
- ALWAYS make sure the code is well tested and edge cases are covered. Design the code for testability and be extremely thorough.
- ALWAYS write defensive code and make sure all potential errors are handled.
- ALWAYS strive to write highly reusable code with routines that have high fan in and low fan out.
- ALWAYS keep the code DRY.
- ALWAYS research the problem domain and the tech stack being used to ensure you are following the best practices.
- Aim for low coupling and high cohesion. Encapsulate and hide implementation details.
- When creating executable, ALWAYS make sure the functionality can also be used as a library.
  To achieve this, avoid global variables, raise/return errors instead of terminating the program, and think whether the use case of the library requires more control over logging
  and metrics from the application that integrates the library.

## Code commenting guidelines

- Document public APIs and complex modules using standard code documentation conventions.
- Comment the intention behind you code extensively. Omit comments only for very obvious
  facts that almost any developer would know.
- Maintain the comments together with the code to keep them meaningful and current.
- When the code is based on specific formats, standards or well-specified behavior of
  other software, always make sure to include relevant links (URLs) that provide the
  necessary technical details.

### Test writing guidelines

- Each test MUST create a unique log file capturing its full output.
- On success: tests print minimal output to keep logs out of AI context windows.
- On failure: the test runner prints the path and file size of the relevant log(s) so developers (or agents) can open them directly without flooding the console or context.
- Rationale: preserves context-budget for AI tools by avoiding large inline logs, while retaining full fidelity in files.
- NEVER cheat with the tested assertions in order to satisfy a specified Verification requirement (e.g. one from a .status.md file)
- ALWAYS prefer creating automated tests instead of managing multiple client and server processes interactively.

#### Unified Test Logging Implementation

Use the `ah-test-utils` crate for consistent test logging across all crates:

```rust
use ah_test_utils::{TestLogger, logged_test, logged_assert};

// Recommended: Use the macro for simple tests
logged_test!(test_my_feature {
    logger.log("Testing my feature").unwrap();
    let result = my_function();
    logged_assert!(logger, result.is_ok(), "Function should succeed");
    logger.log("Test completed").unwrap();
});

// Alternative: Manual TestLogger for complex tests
#[test]
fn test_complex_feature() {
    let mut logger = TestLogger::new("test_complex_feature").unwrap();
    // ... test logic with logger.log() calls ...
    logger.finish_success().unwrap(); // or finish_failure()
}
```

All tests should use this pattern to ensure consistent logging behavior and AI-friendly output.

## Writing git commit messages

- You MUST use multiline git commit messages using heredoc syntax.
- Use the conventional commits style for the first line of the commit message.
- Use the summary section of your final response as the remaining lines in the commit message.
